		    Hi, I'm Shastri. I'm a Robotics Engineer from the amazing country of Trinidad and Tobago, in the Caribbean. After winning the nation's highest award, the President's medal in 2011, I attended Carnegie Mellon University to complete a double major in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Robotics. I graduated in May 2016 with University Honors, and honors from Tau Beta Pi (Engineering Honor Society) and Eta Kappa Nu (Electrical and Computer Engineering Honor Society). Currently I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.

                  <p>
		    With a deep passion for programming, tinkering, hacking and inventing, I absolutlely love working on projects. Previous experience in Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering provides me with the unique ability to speak in different Engineering launguages and I can contribute to many different aspects of a project. However, my specialty lies with software and electronics, and I have done some of my greatest work in these areas. I'm an avid car enthusiast and I love racing. I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, cooking and being an island boy, I love the outdoors and nature!

                            <h2>EZ-Kart</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ez_kart_1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
			      EZ-Kart is an robotic cart that is able to autonomously "follow" in front of a user. This robot was the final  project for the Spring 2016 Robotics Capstone course (16-474) at Carnegie Mellon University. My most major contributions to the project were the development of the controller and the power system. EZ-Kart was built and designed with the collaboration of Clayton Ritcher and Mopewa Ogundipe. Warehouse workers' bodies face a lot of stress and fatigue from constantly pushing heavy carts around the building. EZ-Kart was designed to ease this burden.</p>
			    <br>
			    </br>
			      
			      
			      <p>
			      All the processing is done on an Dell Inspiron laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Idigo Igloo. EZ-Kart uses speech recognition to start and stop following with the words "EZ-Kart Start" and "EZ-Kart Stop" respectively.The user speaks to the robot via a bluetooth headset with feeds the audio input into a speech recognition library. The robot locates a user using the April Tag computer vision library. The user wears the April tag at chest height and the images captured from the PS Eye camera is fed into the library which returns the distance of the user from the robot, as well as the angular offset of the user from the robot.

				<figcaption style="text-align:center"> The PS Eye camera, LED User Interface and Bluetooth Headset for communication with EzKart.

				</figure>
			   

			    <br>
			    </br>
			    
			    <p>
			      A message with the distance and angle offset is passed to the controller. The controller consists of two series PD control loops, which output the left and right motor PWM signals. The PWM signals are passed to an ROS/Arduino node which sends the PWM signals via serial to an Arduino Uno. The signal is then relayed to the motor controllers for each wheel. The motors have been limited to move at walking speed (approximately 3 mph) and were selected with a gearbox which enable the robot to easily carry 30lbs of cargo. 
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      Additionally EZ-Kart has an ultrasonic distance sensor detects situated at the front of the robot. It alerts the controller when an object is with 2 feet of the robot and the controller responds by immediately stopping the robot. The user can then walk backwards to move the robot from the obstacle or can take manual control of the robot itself. The ability to have the robot be manually pushed in the case of an obtacle or low battery was a design criteria of the project. 
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      The robot features a very simple but effective user interface. Three LED lights located on the hanldle illuminates to let the user know if there a low battery, an obtacle detected or if the robot has lost the user. Additionally, the robot had the ability to speak, alerting the user audibly if any of these situation arise. The entire robot is powered from a rechargeable sealed lead acid battery. A power distribution board splits the voltage along a 12V and 5V rail to power different components. Additionally, an inverter conencted to the battery, powers the laptop.	The system is capable of continuous operation for 4 hours.            </p>

                            <br>
			    </br>
			    
			    <p>
			      EZ-Kart was developed with the user in mind. The system is hands free and easy to use. It has the form factor of a traditional cart and the user virtually pushes the cart in a manner similar to pushing a traditional cart. This maintains a level of familiarity for users.

                            <h2>TrashBot</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/trashBot/meWithRobot.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>TrashBot is a trash sorting robot.  It  was my Electrical and Computer Engineering capstone project for Mechatronic Design (18-578). For this project, I was the principal embedded software engineer and the power/electrical system designer. TrashBot was built in collaboration with Akash Sonthalia, Vikas Sonthalia, Stephen Cunningham, Sophia Acevdo and Astha Keshan. The requirements for TrashBot were:
			      
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Classify trash into four categories: metal, glass, plastic and other.</li>
  <li>Sort/store trash input into two categories: recyclables(metal/plastic/glass) and non-recyclables(other).</li>
  <li>Trash input slot must be at a minimum of 40" high.</li>
  <li>Total machine volume cannot exceed 42 gallons.</li>
  <li>Must have the to count the number of objects in each classification category.</li>
  <li>The bins must have a combined capacity of 30 gallons, and must be easily removable.</li>
  <li>Must accept 15 trash items at an average speed of 1 item/3 seconds.</li>
  <li>Must have a classification accuracy of 85% and a sorting accuracy of 85%.</li>
</ul>
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      TrashBot uses outputs from an array of sensors to determine the type of object that needs to be sorted. A trash item is deposited into the chute at the top of the robot. The presence of an object is detected with an ultrasonice distance sensor located at the top of the chute. An inductive proximity sensor detects whether the object is metal or not. If the object is metal, it drops into the second compartment which translates to the recyclables bin. If the object is not metal, the other sensors are read. The chute contains two IR(Infrared) sensors which measure the reflectivity of IR light at a wavelength on 810nm. The chute flap opens and drops the trash item into the second compartment where the the weight of the object is detected with a load cell. All of the data from the sensors is fed into the Arduino Mega micro-controller which runs a decision tree algorithm to make a calculated guess to determine the type of trash. The box then translates left or right to deposit the trash into the approrate bin.    
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      Ultrasonic distance sensors above the bin determine the bin fullness. The bin fullness along with the number of each type of item is displayed on the LCD screen. The front acrylic panel is displayed green when it is safe for the user to input a trash item and red when it is not. *Insert Pic of UI here*
			    </p>

			    <br>
                            </br>
			    <p>
			      All of the processing and classification occurs on the Arduini Mega micro-controller. The code runs the statechart pictured below. *Insert pic of statechart* 
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      The cyberphyhsical architect is laid out as shown below. The Arduino Uno controls the UI LED Lights. A second micro-controller was needed because the control of the lights greatly slowed down the execution of the main loop in the Arduino Mega, which in turn cause the trash sorting and classification to run longer than it should. *Include pic of cyberphysical architecture*
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			      <p>
				From calculations, it was determined that the system would need a max of 5A. Additionaly some componenets needed 12V while others needed 5V. A power supply was selected that had the ability to deliver the amperage at 12V. A regulator stepped the 12V down to 5V. The power system employed the use of fuse boxes to distribute the 5V and 12V supplies. The benefits of the fuse box design included ease of wiring, ease of debugging and the ability to keep the wiring in a systematic manner. An emergency stop button and a breaker were included to protect the system from faults. The power system wiring diagram is shown below. *Include pic of power system*
				</p>

			      <br>
			      </br>

			    <p>
			      TrashBot was a resounding success. My team won 1st place in the design competition, sorting 15 objects in 37 seconds with a classification ad sorting accuracy of 93%!! Enjoy our video below!

                            <h2>Iron Man Arm</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ironManArm_0.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
			      The Iron Man Arm was my entry into the Build 18 2016 Hackation. This project served as a proof of concept for strength augmentation. It was built within four days using aluminum, custom 3D printed parts, flex sensors, EMG sensors with an Arduino running custom control code.  It was created in collaboraton with Johnathon Dyer, who worked on the mechanical design of the arm. I desgined the software, electronics and power system for the arm.  
			    </p>
			    
			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      Creating an arm that increase the strength of the wearer would involve the use of hydraulics or pneumatics. However with only a budget of $300.00, this would not be possible. However, by showing that we could create a prosthetic that could hold the weight of the wearer's arm, it would prove that actual strength augmentation would be achievable. A high torque servo was chosen so that it could lift the weight of an average human arm.
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>
			    
			    <p>
			    A flex sensor placed on the elbow detects when the arm is bending. The Arduino Uno continuously reads the flex sensor and sends a control signal to move the servo depending on the amount the arm flexes. The EMG (Electromyography) sensors detected when the forearm muscle was contracted. This would illuminate the LED ring on the Iron Man glove, similar to the Iron Man suit in the movies.

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      After a continuous 3 hours of use, the housing for the velcro began to fatigue and fail hence the reason the exoskeleton arm slipped down my arm. However, the servo continued functioning and was able hold the weight of my arm with no effort at all.

                            <p>The aim of this project was to develop a system that would be able to classify an image into 8 categories: aquarium,
			      beach, bridge, conference room, gas station, park, parking lot and waterfall. Two approaches were taken, a bag of words
			      method using a spatial matching histogram and a support vector machine (SVM). </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      A bank of 38 filters (gaussian, sobel, laplacian, and gabor) were appliied to each image in the training set. Points were
			      selected from the filter responses and clustered using K-Means to create the visual words for the dictionary. Then each image
			      in the training set was represented using the visual words and a spatial pyramid matching histogram was used to capture semantic
			      meaning from the image. TO classify an image in the training set, the image was represented using the visual words, its spatial
			      pyramind matching histogram obtained and then compared to the histograms of the training set images using the histogram intersection
			      metric as the distance measure. The prediction was then class of the test image which had the nearest distance to the training image.
			      The accuracy of this method depended on the size of the dictionary and the number of points of each image used to create the dictionary.
			      After testing various values of these parameters, the best accuracy obtained was 61.25%. 
			    </p>

			    <br>
		            </br>

			    <p>
			      For the SVM method, the visual word representation of the images of the training set were used as input into the libsvm package. This gave
			      an accuracy of 68.13%, an improvement over the previous method.

			       This project employed the use of image processing algorithms to create a Hough Transform based line detector, using the Matlab programming environment. For this project, Matlab's built in image processing toolbox was not used. The input image was convolved with gaussian and sobel filters to obtain the x and y derivatives of the image. Non-maximum suppression was then used to get egdes that are one pixel wide. The result of these operations would give the edges of the objects in the image. However, the goal was to extract the lines of the image. To this end, the lines were extracted using the Hough Transform method. Each edge in the image voted for the possible line that it could represent. These votes were stored in an accumulator. The accumulator then underwent non-maximum supression to determine the main lines from the image.
			         
			    </p>
			    
			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      It must be noted that the success of the line detector depends heavily on the values of different parameters throughout the image processing pipeline. This is discussed in my final report, linked below. The final report also gives the results.

                            <p>The Desktop Water Fountain Spectrum Display is an entertainment device that connects via a 3.5mm jack to any media player. The water fountain dances in the same pattern of the audio spectrum of the sound being played. It  was done for the annual Build18 competition held at Carnegie Mellon University. This project won the Build18 Officer's Choice Award. It was done in collaboration with Miller Sakmar</p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>A spectrum analyzer board outputs the amplitude of 7 frequency bands of the sound being played. An Arduino Uno takes this as an input and outputs a proportional signal to a custom designed circuit that filters and amplifies the signal which is used to control 7 waterpumps to shoot jets of water in a pattern and height equivalent to the frequency spectrum of the sound being played. A BOSS 400W amplifier boosts the sound and outputs it through a pair of Pioneer 6x9 speakers.    </p>

			      This humanoid robotic hand was final project for 16-264 Humanoids course, taught by Professor Chris Atkenson. It was done in collaboration with Miller Sakmar and Yichu Jin. The human hand is a complex device and it allows us to carry out all our daily tasks. Not only do the fingers move to grip objects, but also, the palm itself moves. About an inch from the fingers, the palm pivots, in addition to pivoting diagonally across the palm. Without this movement, objects will be more difficult to grip because the palm first wraps around and object and then the fingers secure it in place. All of the robotic hands today have finger acutation, that is, the fingers move in a way similar to human fingers. However very few robotic hands have palm actuation. Those that do are very expensive. As such, the aim of this project was to develop a humanoid robotic hand with palm acutation.

			      The fingers of the hand were taken from a kids grabber toy. The palm was made from particle board. The top section of the hand, with the four fingers was attached to the top of the palm with a small hinge. A slanted cut was placed along the palm and the thumb was attached to this. This entire setup was then attached to the hand via a small hinge. These mimiced the two points of actuation similar to a human hand. Fishing wire was then woud through the fingers. This can be seen below.

			      The finshing line was connected to servos. An additional smaller motor was attached to the thumb to move it. A spring was attached to the back of the actuation point at the top of palm to return it to the resting position when a force was not being applied. The following two images show the final setup.

			    <p>
			      To control the hand, a glove was retrofitted with flex sensors on each of the fingers and the palm. The flex sensors are resistors which change their resistance based on how much they are bent. This data was sent to the two Arduino Unos which transformed the reading from the sensors to the appropriate angle each servo needs to turn in order to move the fingers and palm of the robot hand in a manner similar to the human hand. Below is the project video which shows the palm in action. Below the video is a link which details the design and build process of the hand.

                            <p>
			      Brick Breaker was my first major programming project. It was the final project for 15-112 Intro to Programming class at Carnegie Mellon University. The game has a welcoming user interface which displays all the necessary information about the current game as well as helpful hints for the user. The player proceeds through 3 levels of gameplay, each one increasing in difficulty with more complex bricks and brick patterns. The player can collect bonuses to make gameplay more fun and interactive.
			    </p>

			    <br>
			    </br>

			    <p>
			      Brick Breaker was programmed in Python and made use of the tkinter module. The most complicated part of the project was programming in the physics of the moving ball. It made use of Newton's 3rd Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. As such when the ball hit a brick, the ball was programmed to rebound with the same speed in the opposite direction. An example that showed how well this worked, was when the ball hit a corner of the brick, it rebounded with the same speed at the exact approach angle that it took to the corner of the brick. This models what would happen in perfect condition in reality.
